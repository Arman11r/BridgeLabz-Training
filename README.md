# BridgeLabz-Training

**BridgeLabz – Capgemini Training Repository**

This repository contains my daily practice work across different topics and branches.  
Currently, I am actively working on the **`core-java-practice`** branch.

## Active Branch: `core-java-practice`

This branch contains my **Core Java learning and practice**, organized topic-wise into folders as part of BridgeLabz training.
