Right now I’m actively working on the **`core-java-practice`** branch.

## Next Updates

As I add more folders and practice modules on `core-java-practice`, I’ll keep expanding this README with:
- direct links to each folder/module,
- a short “what I learned / what I implemented” summary per day,
- and references to problem statements where applicable.
